# FPAndroid
A native Android app for browsing the world's best SA clone!

## About
Creating a native app to interface with a vBulletin forum shouldn't be (and isn't) that complicated:
your browser doesn't need a fancy JSON API, so why should your phone? This app simply sends the same HTTP requests
as your browser would in order to authenticate, view threads, post, etc. Android handles cookies for us and
we're free to argue about politics and report Rust hackers from the comfort of our mobile devices (iOS is out of luck, for now).

## Roadmap / Developing
The app currently needs the following features to be considered "complete" and worth releasing:
* Proper post parsing, i.e. images and possibly videos
* User avatars
* Post editing
* Thread creation
* Quoting posts

The app is obviously open source and hypothetically everyone could just make their own forks and release a million Facepunch
apps on the Play Store, but I ask that out of courtesy any developers just contribute directly to this project, submit pull
requests, and when the app is ready for release I'll use my developer account for publishing.
